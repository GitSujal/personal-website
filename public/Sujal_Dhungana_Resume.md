## EXPERIENCE

### Resident Platform Engineer (Contractor)

Telstra October 2024 - Present,Perth, WA
Optimised data pipelines ingesting over 1TB/hr of log data to Clickhouse and Opensearch, including separating IO-bound and CPU-
bound operations, parallelization of operations to utilise idle CPU cores, coupled with event-based scaling of Kubernetes resources, resulted
in a savings of over 50% in compute cost (valued at over $600,000 per annum) without compromising latency and platform reliability.

#### •

```
Designed and built a suite of internal toolings and RESTful APIs to automate the provisioning and management of K8s applications,
ensuring consistency and reducing the time taken to create data pipelines from days to hours.
```
#### •

```
Ensured platform uptime exceeds SLA through rigorous change management, regular rolling updates, and leading incident response,
maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction.

### Principal Data Engineer

Data Vanguards Pty Ltd. April 2024 - Present,Perth, WA
Technical Lead: Architected and led the development of the world's first Warehouse agnostic (Bring your own warehouse like Redshift,
Athena, Snowflake, etc.), agentic Data Platform. Empowering AI agents with comprehensive, governed access to pipeline metadata, status,
and data models to establish data provenance and enable secure, context-aware analytical reports.

#### •

```
Developed a fully automated end-to-end MLOPs pipeline to generate item recommendations for potential bidders to one of the biggest
horse auctioneers in Australia.
```
#### •

```
Developed a lightweight high-frequency ingestion pipeline to seamlessly ingest IoT data into the data warehouse, enabling near real-time
analytical capabilities using native AWS APIs, Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, Glue Catalogue and Redshift.
```
#### •

```
Designed and deployed a Data Ingestion Platform to standardise data ingestion and introduced Medallion layers following the modern
data architecture. Reducing the time taken to onboard new data sources by 60% (as the pipeline between each layer is standardised and
reused) while also reducing the maintenance effort.
```
#### •

```
Redesigned and developed an ingestion pipeline on AWS, significantly enhancing reliability and maintainability while reducing
operational costs by 90%, resulting in annual savings of over $30K in cloud expenses.

### Senior Data Engineer


Water Corporation May 2022 - April 2024,Perth, WA
Created an end-to-end MLOPs pipeline leveraging AWS native cloud stacks (SageMaker, Code Build, Step Functions, Lambda), significantly
reducing the time to production from days to minutes with minimal manual intervention. The MLOPs pipeline enabled seamless cross-
account deployment of ML models with a simple click of a button while also providing appropriate governance with manual validations and
approval steps in between.

#### •

```
Productionised ML model to predict Centrifuge Performance using real-time operational data, voted one of the top papers in the OzWater
conference 2024.
```
#### •

```
Designed and developed an end-to-end ingestion platform that ingests data from various sources into Apache Iceberg tables in S3,
incorporating data quality reporting and dimensional modelling with SCD capabilities out of the box. This innovation cut pipeline build
time from 2 days to 2 hours and reduced cloud costs by 50% with a config-driven approach.
```
#### •

```
Developed an automated reporting platform enabling self-serve analytics teams to build data models with SQL, reducing model build time
by 50% and eliminating production delays with automated workflows.
```
#### •

```
Developed various large-scale data ingestion pipelines for sources (including PI, GIS, SQL servers), and implemented business logic using
PySpark in AWS Glue ETL, resulting in a data product that facilitates the management of AUD 2.3 billion worth of assets through objective
risk assessment.
```
#### •

```
Automated data validation and quality assurance with test scripts, reducing test times from days to hours, and ensuring the freshness and
accuracy of data in AWS Redshift.
```
